# Intel® Generic Implementation of LAGraph* for Go*

This library is work in progress. Do not use it in production. There is still a lot of missing functionality, the API might still change substantially, and performance is not yet good in all cases. Do not report any performance numbers based on this library.

This is a native Go implementation of the LAGraph library. See
https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph for the original version of LAGraph.
This implementation uses the Intel® Generic Implementation of GraphBLAS*
for Go*, available at https://github.com/intel/forGraphBLASGo.

The contents of the testdata folder is taken from the data folder at
https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph.
