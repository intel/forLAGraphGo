# Intel® Generic Implementation of LAGraph* for Go*

This library is work in progress. Do not use it in production
There is still a lot of missing functionality, the API might still change
substantially, and performance is not yet good. Do not report any 
performance numbers based on this library.

This is a native Go implementation of the LAGraph library. See
https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph for the original version of LAGraph.
This implementation uses the Intel® Generic Implementation of GraphBLAS*
for Go*, available at https://github.com/intel/forGraphBLASGo.

The contents of the testdata folder is taken from the data folder at
